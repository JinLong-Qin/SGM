# SGM: A Dataset and Benchmark for 3D Garment Reconstruction from Single-view hand-draw Sketches

## Overviews
We created a large-scale 3D garment model dataset, consisting of 2,500 garment instances across 15 categories simulated from 800 human body models with different shapes.
Each garment model includes two types of annotations:
- Renderings from 36 perspectives: sketches, contours, silhouettes, depth maps, and normal maps, resulting in a total of 180 renderings per garment model.
- Spatial sampling points and UDF (Unsigned Distance Function) values from each sampling point to the surface of the garment model.

The dataset is currently being expanded and produced, and we will make it publicly available after the publication of our paper.

**The dataset description and other relevant information will be updated subsequently.**
